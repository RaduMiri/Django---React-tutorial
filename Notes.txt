0) pip install django djangorestframework
1) Make the project run
    django-admin startproject (project_name)
2) Make the first app for the api run
    cd music_controller
    django-admin startapp api
3) Add in settings.py to installed apps the api
    'api.apps.ApiConfig'
    'rest_framework'
    The ApiConfig function is made in apps in the initialized app when you startapp
    rest_framework we'll need in a minute
4) Making the views, btw, they all need the request parameter and return eitehr a HttpResoponse, or a render
5) Setup urls in the app folder, urls.py which needs to be made, then register the urls in the project urls.py
5.1) To not get the migrations error just run
    python .\manage.py makemigrations
    python .\manage.py migrate
    even though there are no models to migrate yet
6) Now make the models in the models.py. They are clases that inherit models.Model
    Django likes Fat models and thin views, so put most of the logic in the models
    !Ids are automatically made
7) Make serializers, which make models intro strings for json
